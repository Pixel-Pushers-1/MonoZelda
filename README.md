Code review and maintainability is not limited to the Pull Requests. We have daily design discussions within our method of comunication (Discord). We would be happy to share those conversations if needed to show our dedication in this regard. We understand the formality of conversation in Discord is lacking, but we believe that it is the best way to share opinions and reflect on them.
